# Numerical-Methods
Numerical Methods course that addressed complex engineering challenges using MATLAB. Core Topics included root finding, linear systems, interpolation, least squares, numerical integration/differentiation, and ODEs.

The Midterm folder encapsulates a rigorous exploration of computational accuracy and error assessment, foundational to numerical methods, as detailed in Module 4. Progressing to Module 5, it thoroughly examines root-finding algorithms, from Incremental Search to Brent's Method, ensuring a strong grasp of iterative solution techniques. Module 6 shifts focus to Linear Algebra, presenting strategies for solving linear systems, with an emphasis on Row Reduction, LU Factorization, and Matrix Inversion techniques, concluding with the Newton method for nonlinear systems.

Post Midterm, the folder delves into advanced numerical techniques beginning with Regression Analysis, exploring both linear and nonlinear models, and extending to Least Squares Methods with a focus on error metrics. It then progresses to Interpolation, examining classical approaches such as Newton's and Lagrange's methods. The journey continues through sophisticated Numerical Integration strategies, including Simpsonâ€™s rules and the stochastic Monte Carlo method. Numerical Differentiation is addressed next, with a detailed look at error estimation and Richardson extrapolation. The culmination of this learning path is the study of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), featuring methods for ensuring stability and the implementation of various Runge-Kutta algorithms.
